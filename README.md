## Milestone 1 (Nov Week 1): Project Proposal & Introduction
In our mnilestone 1 within this week our group will focus on finalizing the database prototype and identifying the requires entities and attributes as we will proceed to create the initial API.

Github will be updated when progress is made specially the README.md file. We would most likely use the checklist to have a progress check on what we have currently finished and the milestones would be continuously improved. And to continuously have proof of progress we would be updating and adding files to the github

## Checklists 
"[] Create Initial progress for database," "[] Finalize key entities and attributes," "[] Create initial front end,"
